ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* BlogMoveWave.iml
* BlogMoveWave.ipr
* BlogMoveWave.iws
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* out\
* out\production\
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\BlogMoveWave.apk
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\BlogMoveWave.unaligned.apk
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\BuildConfig.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\MyActivity.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\MyView$1.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\MyView.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\R$attr.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\R$drawable.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\R$id.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\R$layout.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\R$string.class
* out\production\BlogMoveWave\com\harvic\BlogMoveWave\R.class
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => blogMoveWave\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => blogMoveWave\src\main\assets
* res\ => blogMoveWave\src\main\res\
* src\ => blogMoveWave\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
